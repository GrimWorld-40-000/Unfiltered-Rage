	<description>Behold, the One Angry Chair, the greatest melee weapon ever beheld by the legendary Angry Marines. No Khornate Berserker could ever hope to match the impossible-potent, impossibly-pure rage of one who would wield this deadly weapon, this Excalibur of chairs. \n\n"ALWAYS ANGRY! ALL THE TIME!"</description>
